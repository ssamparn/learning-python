# python variables: create and update
a = 1
print(a)

a, b, c, d, e = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
print(a, b, c, d, e)

''' 
Best practices for declaring python variables:
    1. Use descriptive variable names. Instead of a or b, use temperature or age as variable names for clarity.
    2. Consistency is key. Try to maintain the same datatype for a variable to avoid unexpected errors.
    3. Always mind the indentation. Always indent your python code properly to avoid indentation syntax errors.
