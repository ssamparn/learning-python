'''
ğŸ”¢ Using is with Integers:
Python caches integers, so variables assigned the same integer point to the same object in memory.

So:
a == b â†’ compares values â†’ True

ğŸ“¦ Using is with Lists:
Lists are mutable, and Python does not automatically reuse list objects, even if they have the same content.
